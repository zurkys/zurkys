Hey im zurkys, a fivem developer looking for clients everyday so be my guest and let me know if you would like a server to be quickly yours

(discord: zxrkys#8131)
(email: zurkysa@gmail.com)
(fiverr: zurkyse)

i am active on all my socials everyday!

More about me:
ive played fivem for a good 2 years now too a point it was time to get deeper into gaming, which ended me up developing servers for the cheapest price. I dont only have my own server (Streetcity)
but develop in many others (TrapMoneyRP, SerpentRP, InfiniteRP and HoodRichRP) I am well know for the cheapest dev in history :) 

I am on Github to promote/help other developers out and give you resources/scripts that you are probably looking for!

What makes you a good developer?
I am very known for the best optimiser and quickest developer. I will make the server all to your liking and take your suggestiongs seriously!
